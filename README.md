# PenguinAssignment
This is where the files will be for my Reproducible Research assignment on penguins.

The data folder contains saved versions of the raw and clean data, the figures data contains saved .png files of the figures which I have produced, and the functions folder contains the cleaning script which contains the cleaning functions used in my main script.

main_penguin.rmd is the file which contains the code for this assignment (apart from that which is read in from the cleaning.R file).

main_penguin.pdf shows the knitted R markdown file as a pdf.
